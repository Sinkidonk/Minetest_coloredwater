# Minetest_coloredwater <br>

<h1>I am leaving this hear as it is if anyone what try and get this to work, for the most part I am done trying to get post_effect_color to work with loop I will still try hear and there to get it to work I will not make it one of the main thing to do anymore.</h1>

Also forgive any mistake I may make I am somewhat new at lua codeing, and github well I a total noob when it come to github so that that. So I am sorry if I don't upload the files the right way, I will try my best. <br>

Please note that the colors.txt file, and the gentextures.sh file are not my they are both by VanessaE.<br> <br>



TO DO <br>
1. Done - add the WTFPL â€“ Do What the Fuck You Want to Public License. <br>
2. Done - remove over 600+ textures, and start useing the Texture modifiers (Thank Hybrid Dog for pointing that out.) <br>
3. Done for now - add more color. <br>
4. ??? <br>
5. profit <br> <br> 

Thing I may do <br>
1. Major rewrite of the code only if I can get post_effect_color to work with loop. This is mainly for I can edit part of the code more easily without hunting for it.

<h3>Thing to add in the near future</h3>
1. colored water biome ( was going to add it sooner but found out that Mapgen v6 don't allow new biome, only redefind existence biome in the world. So I will wait until Mapgen v7 is finish, to add in biome. Unless someone else what to add it in before then I will be more then willing to add it to the main mod.<br>
<b>Update: </b> I have decide to start working on colored water biome for Mapgen v7 when I get done with the major rewrite of the code, if I can get that post_effect_color to work with loop that is. If not I will start as soon as I abandon the major rewrite of the code.
