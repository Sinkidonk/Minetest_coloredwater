<h3>Thing to add in the near future</h3>
1. colored water biome ( was going to add it sooner but found out that Mapgen v6 don't allow new biome, only redefind existence biome in the world. So I will wait until Mapgen v7 is finish, to add in biome. Unless someone else what to add it in before then I will be more then willing to add it to the main mod.
